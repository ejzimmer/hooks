It's a react app. It shows some stuff with hooks.

Build it with `yarn`
Run it with `yarn start`. It's on localhost:3000, but `yarn start` should open that anyway

Open the console to see messages when components render, run effects, etc

Click the checkbox to show the actual component. (If you have them all open at once, the console will get very busy). Check out the code to see what's actually going on.

The `useServiceCall` and `useDelayedServiceCall` hooks are obviously cheap fakes, but they work substantially the same way as the real things.
